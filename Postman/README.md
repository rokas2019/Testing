# API Testing with Postman

This repo contains test scripts for API endpoints using Postman.  

## Structure

- `Postman/` — Contains Postman test scripts and collections  
- `.venv/` — Local virtual environment (excluded from GitHub)

## Getting Started

These scripts are written in JavaScript using the Postman test environment.
You can import the Postman folder directly into your Postman app.

More tests will be added soon for POST, PUT, DELETE methods.
